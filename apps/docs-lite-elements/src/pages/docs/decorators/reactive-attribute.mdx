# @reactiveProp
---

This is a decorator that allows you to define a reactive attribute on the element.

It takes an options object with the type of the attribute and whether it should be reflected to the attribute.

Once an update is made to the field, it will inform the component that an update occured.

It plays well in combination with the @onUpdated decorator.

<CodeBlock lang='typescript'>{`@reactiveProp({ type: Number, reflect: true }) declare count: number;`}</CodeBlock>
