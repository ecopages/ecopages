# Creating Pages in Ecopages

Pages are the core of your Ecopages project. They represent the different routes and content of your website. In this guide, we'll explore how to create pages using the ghtml integration.

## Basic Page Structure

A typical page in Ecopages using the ghtml integration consists of a single TypeScript file. Here's a basic example:

```typescript
import { BaseLayout } from '@/layouts/base-layout';
import { type EcoComponent, type GetMetadata, html } from '@ecopages/core';

export const getMetadata: GetMetadata = () => ({
	title: 'Home page',
	description: 'This is the homepage of the website',
	image: 'public/assets/images/default-og.png',
	keywords: ['typescript', 'framework', 'static'],
});

const HomePage: EcoComponent = () => html`${BaseLayout({
	class: 'main-content',
	children: html`<h1>Ecopages</h1><p>Welcome to my Ecopages website!</p>`,
})}`;

HomePage.config = {
	dependencies: {
		components: [BaseLayout],
	},
};

export default HomePage;
```

Let's break down the key elements of a page:

1. **Imports**: Import necessary components and types from `@ecopages/core` and your project files.

2. **Metadata**: Use the `getMetadata` function to define page-specific metadata.

3. **Page Component**: Create your main page component as an `EcoComponent`.

4. **HTML Template**: Use the `html` template literal to define your page's structure.

5. **Config**: Always include the `config` object with any necessary dependencies.

6. **Export**: Export your page component as the default export.

## Using Components in Pages

To use components in your pages, import them and include them in your HTML template:

```typescript
import { RadiantCounter } from '@/components/radiant-counter';
import { BaseLayout } from '@/layouts/base-layout';
import { type EcoComponent, type GetMetadata, html, resolveComponentsScripts, flagComponentsAsDynamic } from '@ecopages/core';

const HomePage: EcoComponent = () => html`${BaseLayout({
	class: 'main-content',
	children: html`
	<h1>Ecopages</h1>
	<scripts-injector
		on:interaction="mouseenter,focusin"
		scripts="${resolveComponentsScripts([RadiantCounter])}"
	>
			!${RadiantCounter({ count: 5 })}
	</scripts-injector>
`,
})}`;

HomePage.config = {
	dependencies: {
		components: [BaseLayout, ...flagComponentsAsDynamic([RadiantCounter])],
	},
};
```

## Working with Data

Ecopages provides built-in support for data fetching and metadata management. For a deep dive into how to handle data at build-time and runtime, check out the [Data Fetching Guide](/docs/guides/data-fetching).

## Lazy Loading Components

Ecopages provides powerful tools for lazy loading components, which can significantly improve your site's performance.

The main tool for this is the custom component `scripts-injector`, which allows you to load scripts only when needed. Two key functions for this are `resolveComponentsScripts` and `flagComponentsAsDynamic`.

### `resolveComponentsScripts`

This function is used to resolve the scripts associated with components for lazy loading. It's typically used with the `scripts-injector` component to ensure scripts are only loaded when a user interacts with a specific part of the page.

### `flagComponentsAsDynamic`

To prevent scripts from being included in the initial page load, you can use `flagComponentsAsDynamic`. This marks the components as "dynamic," allowing their assets to be deferred and loaded later via a `scripts-injector`.

By using these functions, you can create pages that are lightweight on initial load but still provide rich interactivity when needed. This approach is particularly useful for components that are not immediately visible or not used by all users.
