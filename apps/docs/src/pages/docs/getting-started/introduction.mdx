# Welcome to Ecopages

Ecopages is a static site generator currently under active development. While it's still evolving, it's stable enough for use in projects.

## What is Ecopages?

Ecopages is a tool designed to help developers create static websites efficiently. It aims to balance simplicity with the features needed for modern web development, while also considering environmental impact.

### Key Features:

1. **Static Site Generation**: Ecopages creates static HTML files, which can lead to faster load times and reduced server load.

2. **Minimal Dependencies**: We try to keep external dependencies to a minimum to reduce complexity and decrease the overall footprint of your project.

3. **Flexibility**: Ecopages works with various templating options, including MDX, Kita, and Lit.

4. **Built on Bun**: Leveraging Bun's speed for improved build times and energy efficiency.

5. **Tailwind Integration**: Built-in support for Tailwind CSS with PostCSS for efficient styling.

6. **Eco-friendly Approach**: By generating static sites and optimizing asset loading, Ecopages aims to reduce the energy consumption of websites built with it.

## Current Status

Ecopages is in active development. While it's functional and can be used for projects, you may encounter bugs or missing features. We're continuously working on improvements and welcome feedback from users.

## Environmental Consideration

We believe that every bit counts when it comes to reducing the environmental impact of web development. Ecopages strives to create lightweight, efficient websites that consume less energy both during development and in production. However, we're still learning and improving in this area, and we welcome ideas on how to make Ecopages even more eco-friendly.

## Getting Started

If you're interested in trying Ecopages, check out our [Installation Guide](/docs/getting-started/installation). We recommend starting with small projects as you get familiar with the tool.

We appreciate your interest in Ecopages and welcome any contributions or feedback you might have as we continue to develop and improve the project, both in terms of functionality and environmental impact.
