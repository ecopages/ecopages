# Integrations Overview

Ecopages is framework-agnostic. You can use one or multiple rendering integrations together in the same project. Each integration brings its own strengths to the table.

## Comparison Table

| Integration | Technology | Primary Use Case | SSR Support |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[KitaJS](/docs/integrations/kitajs)** | JSX (Fast) | High-performance static sites | Full |
| **[React 19](/docs/integrations/react)** | React | Dynamic apps, rich interactivity | Full |
| **[Lit](/docs/integrations/lit)** | Web Components | Reusable UI, micro-frontends | Full |
| **[MDX](/docs/integrations/mdx)** | Markdown + JSX | Documentation, Blogs, Content | Full (via React) |

## Choosing an Integration

### Use KitaJS if...
- You want the best possible performance for static pages.
- You like JSX syntax but don't need the overhead of a full frontend framework.
- You are building a content-heavy site (docs, blogs, marketing).

### Use React if...
- You are building a complex dashboard or interactive app.
- You want to leverage the massive React ecosystem and libraries.
- You are familiar with React Server Components patterns.

### Use Lit if...
- You want to build standard-compliant Web Components.
- You want your components to be portable across different projects.
- You prefer a more "native" browser feel with declarative templates.

### Use MDX if...
- Your primary focus is content (Markdown).
- You want to embed interactive components directly into your articles.

## Mixing Integrations

You can combine multiple integrations in your `eco.config.ts`. This allows you to use MDX for your blog, KitaJS for your landing page, and React for a specific interactive checkout component.

		When mixing integrations, make sure to set the correct `jsxImportSource` in your MDX configuration if you want it to align with either React or KitaJS.
