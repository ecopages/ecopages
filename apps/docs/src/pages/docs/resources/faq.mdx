# FAQ

## General Questions

### Do I need a server to run Ecopages?
**No**, if you are only using static pages. Ecopages will generate standard HTML/CSS files that can be hosted on any static provider (Vercel, GitHub Pages, Netlify). 
**Yes**, if you use API routes (`app.get`, `app.post`) or dynamic server logic.

### Is Ecopages ready for production?
Ecopages is currently in **Beta**. While it is stable enough for many projects and used in production for several sites, the API might evolve. We recommend following our [GitHub](https://github.com/ecopages/ecopages) for updates.

### How does Ecopages compare to Next.js or Astro?
- **vs Next.js**: Ecopages is significantly lighter, built on Bun instead of Node, and doesn't force a specific framework (like React). It uses a "you don't always need a server" philosophy.
- **vs Astro**: Similar in "zero-JS by default" goal, but Ecopages provides a more unified server API and deeply integrates with Bun's native features like the lightning-fast bundler and image processor.

## Technical Questions

### Can I use React and Lit components together?
**Yes!** Since Ecopages is framework-agnostic, you can mix them. You can use Lit Web Components inside your React pages, or vice versa (though using React components inside Lit usually requires a bit more setup for hydration).

### How do I add a new integration?
Ecopages is built to be extended. You can create a new integration by extending the `IntegrationPlugin` class. Check out our [Custom Integration](/docs/plugins/custom-integration) guide.

### Why is my HMR not working?
Most HMR issues are caused by:
1. Missing `*.script.ts` suffix on client files.
2. Forgetting to register the script in the component `config.dependencies.scripts`.
3. Blocking WebSocket ports on your local machine.

### Can I use Tailwind CSS?
**Yes!** Ecopages has first-class support for Tailwind CSS via the `@ecopages/postcss-processor`. It is highly recommended to use the `@apply` directive in CSS files to keep your components clean.
