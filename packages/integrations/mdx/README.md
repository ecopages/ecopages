# Ecopages MDX Integration Plugin

The `@ecopages/mdx` package facilitates the integration of MDX, allowing for the smooth rendering of Markdown mixed with JSX. This integration leverages the `@mdx-js/esbuild` plugin behind the scenes, providing a streamlined layer within the Ecopages integration plugin system to enhance the platform's adaptability and user-friendliness.

## Install

```bash
bunx jsr add @ecopages/mdx
```

## Usage

Integrating MDX into your Ecopages project is made simple. Import and apply the `mdxPlugin` in your Ecopages configuration as demonstrated below:

```ts
import { ConfigBuilder } from "@ecopages/core";
import { mdxPlugin } from "@ecopages/mdx";

const config = await new ConfigBuilder()
  .setBaseUrl(process.env.ECOPAGES_BASE_URL)
  .setIntegrations([mdxPlugin()])
  .build();

export default config;
```
