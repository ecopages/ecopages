# Why embark on this journey?

Ecopages, at its core, is my personal exploration ground.
It's a realm where I delve into innovative ideas and the latest technologies.
The ever-evolving and boundless nature of the web has always held a certain allure for me.

As time passed, I noticed a growing complexity in web development.
This complexity piqued my interest, leading me to question its roots and wonder about potential simplifications.

This inquisitiveness sparked the creation of Ecopages.
It's my expedition into the labyrinth of web development, an attempt to understand how we can build web applications in a more uncomplicated way.
It's about delving deeper into the tools we use and the obstacles we face.

Ecopages is not yet a finished product, but rather a reflection of my ongoing experiments and learnings.
It's a journey, and I invite you to join me as we navigate the fascinating world of web development together.
